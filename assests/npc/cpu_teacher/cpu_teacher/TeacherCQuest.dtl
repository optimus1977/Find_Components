Let’s just say... a little experiment got out of hand. But never mind that! You need to hurry before someone steps on them. Be sure to check every corner, under the desks, and even behind objects!

There should be [X] CPUs in total. Keep an eye out and don’t leave any behind. Once you have them all, come back here, and I’ll have something for you in return!
