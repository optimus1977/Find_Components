Alright, [Student’s Name], I have a special task for you. In the next classroom, some CPUs have been scattered around. Your mission is to find them all and bring them back to me.

Scattered? How did that happen?
Let’s just say... a little experiment got out of hand. But never mind that! You need to hurry before someone steps on them. Be sure to check every corner, under the desks, and even behind objects!

Got it! How many CPUs do I need to find?
There should be [X] CPUs in total. Keep an eye out and don’t leave any behind. Once you have them all, come back here, and I’ll have something for you in return!
A reward? Now we’re talking! Alright, I’ll find them!
That’s the spirit! Good luck, and don’t get distracted!
